Lab 0 Writeup
=============

My name: Ha Tran

My SUNet ID: hahntrn

This lab took me about [10] hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 444340

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [describe]
C++ things that I wasn't as familiar with like initialization list, 
building in a different folder, getting the formatting of the webget requests
exactly correct (I spent a long time figuring out that I was missing an 
extra \r\n). Also figuring out that I was supposed to update the bytes read
in the pop method as opposed to the read method took a little longer to 
parse than I expected because I couldn't figure out how to run each test files
in gdb since the binary files are all in the build folder where I didn't 
think to look.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]
- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]
- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
